# Tic-Tac-Toe Game using MinMax Algorithm:
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm. The game allows you to play against the computer, which makes optimal moves using the Minimax algorithm.

# How to Play:
To play the game, simply run the tictactoe.py script. The game will prompt you to make moves as the human player, and the AI will respond with its move using the Minimax algorithm.

# Features:
1. Human vs. AI Tic-Tac-Toe gameplay.
2. The AI player employs the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.
3. Board displayed after each move for easy visualization.
4. Error handling for invalid user inputs.
# Files:
1. tictactoe.py: Contains the Python code for the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
2. README.md: Provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to play the game.
# Usage:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/anjupy/Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-using-MinMax-Algorithm.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-using-MinMax-Algorithm
3. Run the game:
   python tictactoe.py
4. Follow the prompts to make your moves and play against the AI.
